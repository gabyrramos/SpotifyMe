# Welcome to my project called SpotifyMe!

This project is a facial detector app that reads your emotions and then recommends playlists on spotify according to them. 

So far I have implemented the facial recognition using Open CV/Deepface. Also I'm using spotipy to establish authorization as well as playlists for the appropriate emotion. 

My intention is to continue working on the architecture as well as the stack for web and mobile and perhaps add other features.
